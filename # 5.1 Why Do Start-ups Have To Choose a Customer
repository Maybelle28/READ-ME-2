# <title> Why Do Start-ups Have To Choose a Customer?  
  All businesses ultimately need to be paid. A customer is any person, group, or organization who will pay a business money for any of its goods or services. For this reason, as customers are the source of a start-up’s revenue, many put great weight on whom a start-up is likely to service. Indeed, it is the first question many investors ask.
Yet for any start-up whose underlying idea has the potential to create mean- ingful consumer value, the question most often is not whether any potential cus- tomers exist, but which customer to choose. At the earliest stages of a venture, entrepreneurs do not have the resources to serve all potential customers with equal attention and care. But even if resources were not an issue, as we will dis- cuss, the customers an entrepreneur chooses to focus on initially are not likely to be the customers that end up at the core of the entrepreneur’s business.
  History is filled with examples of successful ventures that started out with very different customers than those for which the ventures were ultimately known. Facebook famously started serving the college student market before taking a broader approach and establishing as its primary customers advertisers who wanted to reach the social networking site’s users. Microsoft began devel- oping software for another, larger firm, IBM, before turning into a company that sold that software directly to IBM’s customers.
**inherent value** A customer’s worth to an organization, derived from their
willingness to pay for a start-up’s products and/or services
**strategic** value The added value of some particular customers who prove more useful than others because they can unlock broader market segments

  Customer choice is important not only because of certain customers’ poten- tial inherent value to the organization derived from their willingness to pay for a start-up’s products and/or services, but also because certain customers can provide strategic value to the venture. In short, and for a variety of reasons, a particular customer may prove more useful in unlocking broader customer seg- ments than others. Most often, customer value comes from helping the founding team learn from them and experiment with and improve the early product or service. Customer value also comes from using a customer’s satisfaction with the product to influence a targeted set of follow-on customers. Indeed, earlier customers may directly assist in selling the product to later adopters. Finally, certain customer segments may have more coherence, or alignment, with the venture’s other strategic choices. While ignoring the strategic value of poten- tial customer segments will not prevent a founding team from finding some ini- tial customers, doing so can leave the start-up strategically farther away from other, potentially more lucrative customers. Because initial customer selection influences the future of any venture, it is among the most central elements of entrepreneurial strategy.
  One way to understand the importance of initial customer choice is to con- sider falling dominoes. When dominoes are properly aligned, a cascade of the tumbling rectangular blocks can occur by simply tipping the first one. While most demonstrations of falling dominoes use blocks of the same size, in entrepre- neurship, a more interesting idea is to consider a situation where each domino is only two-thirds the size of the next follow-on domino.5 In this arrangement, a single inch-long domino, if lined up with 29 progressively larger dominoes, will eventually topple a domino the height of the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building (Figure 5.1).

  As we will see in the rest of the chapter, the falling domino analogy aptly applies to customer choice. If the goal is to topple large dominoes, then the best strategy is not to try and push one large domino over directly but instead to choose a path whereby toppling a smaller and more manageable domino can lead to a cascade that topples very large ones. Similarly, entrepreneurs want to identify a sequence of market opportunities where (a) there is a path from one customer choice (without significant gaps) to the next and (b) where the initial customers (dominoes) can be manageably tackled. This leads to broader market opportunities so that the business has a path to scale. But to do so, entre- preneurs must truly understand the inherent value they provide to potential customers and the strategic value those customers provide in tackling future customer segments.
